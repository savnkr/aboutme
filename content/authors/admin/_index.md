#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I am Sawan Kumar, a PhD student at IIT Delhi, co-advised by [Prof. Souvik Chakraborty](https://www.csccm.in/our-team) and [Prof. Rajdip Nayek](https://sites.google.com/view/rajdip-nayek/team?authuser=0)

My research focuses on scalable Bayesian methods, uncertainty quantification, physics-aware deep learning, Gaussian Processes, prior modeling, and computational mechanics. Previously, I was an intern at the Foundation for Smart Manufacturing (FSM) at IIT Delhi, working on robotic automation and welding systems. Before that, I applied machine learning and AI techniques to enhance the design and performance of electric vehicles as a team lead for Team Hertz Electric at DTU. I completed my BTech in Mechanical Engineering at Delhi Technological University.
