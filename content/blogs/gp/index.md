Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful tools in machine learning for modeling and inference. They provide a probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines.

## What are Gaussian Processes?

A Gaussian Process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. It's defined by its mean function and covariance function.

## Applications of Gaussian Processes

- Regression
- Classification
- Optimization

## Conclusion

GPs are useful for tasks where uncertainty quantification is important. They are widely used in various fields such as geostatistics, computer graphics, and robotics.
